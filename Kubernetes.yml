Description: "Base ServerTemplate for RightLink10. RightLink10 is a new agent to connect
  servers to the RightScale platform that is very lightweight and simple to install.\r\n_It
  is not a plug-in upgrade from the older RightLink v6 or prior versions._\r\nSee
  [http://docs.rightscale.com/rl/about.html](http://docs.rightscale.com/rl/about.html)
  for details.\r\n\r\nThis base ST includes a few boot scripts that:\r\n\r\n* Wait
  for an EIP to settle (AWS only)\r\n* Sets up a valid hostname\r\n* Enables RightScale
  OS monitoring\r\n* Sets up RightLink10 automatic upgrades\r\n* Enables Docker support\r\n\r\nIt
  has an operational script to force a RightLink10 upgrade. And we also provide a
  decommission script that provides the reason for shutdown. The source of the scripts
  on this ServerTemplate is available at [https://github.com/rightscale/rightlink_scripts/tree/10.4.0](https://github.com/rightscale/rightlink_scripts/tree/10.4.0).\r\n\r\n__Tested

  made available by the cloud provider or the OS developer. Therefore they can be
  deregistered and made unavailable at any time at the discretion of the owner. It
  is advised that you create your own MultiCloud Image with your own custom image
  for Linux or Windows. Please refer to [http://docs.rightscale.com/rl10/reference/rl10_os_compatibility.html#rightscale-tested-images](http://docs.rightscale.com/rl10/reference/rl10_os_compatibility.html#rightscale-tested-images)\r\n\r\nSome
